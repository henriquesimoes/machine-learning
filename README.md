# Machine Learning basics

## Where it was inspired from

The examples available in this repository were produced following the [Daniel Shiffman YouTube videos][10].

## How to run the examples

First, you'll need to install the [Node Package Manager][1]. If you're in a Linux environment that uses apt-get, you can install it by executing the following command on the terminal.

```sh
    sudo apt-get install npm
```
Then, you'll need to install the [p5-manager package][2]. To do so, run the following.

```sh
    sudo npm i -g p5-manager
```
Finally, you'll need to start the p5 server by executing

```sh
    p5 server
```

The server is now running, and you're able to see the examples in the address provided by the previous command (which is, by default, http://localhost:5555).
