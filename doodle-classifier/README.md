# Doodle Classifier

This example relies on the supervised learning concept and uses the [Google QuickDraw dataset][1] for training and testing data. The core idea is to classify a doodle the user draws within one of the categories available.

## How to use it

For getting it ready to be used, first you'll need to follow the steps described in the home [README file][2].

Next, with the example runnning, you'll see that a list of categories are exhibited aside from the canvas. After marking the categories you'd like to work with, you may either train or test the machine learning by clicking on the buttons.

When you want to, you might draw something in the canvas and click on the guess button to have the machine predict what you just drew.
